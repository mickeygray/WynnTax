Wage garnishments take a significant portion of your income, leaving you with less money to cover your living expenses, bills, and basic needs. But there is hope. At Wynn Tax Solutions, we specialize in wage garnishment relief services that focus on negotiating with the IRS to reduce or eliminate garnishments, helping you regain control of your income and get back on track financially.</p><p class="page-body">Wage garnishment happens when the IRS takes a portion of your paycheck directly from your employer to pay off unpaid tax debts. This can occur when you fail to respond to IRS notices, don’t set up a payment plan, or neglect to resolve your tax debt. Garnishments can be a serious and ongoing issue, affecting your finances and causing unnecessary stress. However, there are ways to resolve the garnishment and stop the IRS from continuing to take your hard-earned money.</p><p class="page-body">At Wynn Tax Solutions, we work directly with the IRS to stop or reduce wage garnishments. Our team of tax professionals will evaluate your situation and develop a customized strategy to address your tax debt and halt the garnishment. We understand the pressure that comes with having your wages garnished, and we are here to help you find a solution that minimizes the impact on your financial well-being.</p><p class="page-body">We start by reviewing your tax debt, income, and financial situation to determine the best course of action. This may involve negotiating a payment plan with the IRS, requesting a reduction in the amount being garnished, or exploring other options such as an offer in compromise or penalty abatement. Our goal is to relieve the financial burden of the garnishment, so you can keep more of your income to support yourself and your family.</p><p class="page-body">Wage garnishments can have serious consequences. They not only affect your take-home pay but can also cause problems with your credit, financial stability, and peace of mind. The IRS can continue garnishing your wages until your debt is paid in full, and if you don’t take action, the garnishments can last for months or even years.</p><p class="page-body">We’re here to guide you through every step of the process and help you resolve your tax issues quickly and efficiently. Let us help you take back control of your financial future.</p></section></main><div class="stewart-widget-container"><button aria-label="Open Ask Stewart" class="stewart-fab"><div class="stewart-fab-icon"><svg fill="none" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M12 2C6.48 2 2 6.48 2 12C2 13.54 2.38 14.99 3.06 16.26L2 22L7.74 20.94C9.01 21.62 10.46 22 12 22C17.52 22 22 17.52 22 12C22 6.48 17.52 2 12 2Z" fill="white"></path></svg></div><span class="stewart-fab-text">Ask Stewart</span></button></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-container"><div class="footer-column"><h4>Menu Links</h4><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/our-tax-services">Services</a></li><li><a href="/tax-faqs">Tax FAQs</a></li><li><a href="/about-us">About Us</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news">Tax News</a></li><li><a href="/contact-us">Contact Us</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-column center"><img src="/images/logo-wynn-small.png" alt="Wynn Tax Solutions Logo" class="footer-logo"><p>21625 Prairie Street, Suite #200</p><p>Chatsworth, CA 91311</p><p><a href="tel:+18449966829" class="phone-button" aria-label="Call (844) 996-6829"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa-solid fa-phone"></i> CALL: (844) 996-6829</a></p></div><div class="footer-column"><h4>Recent Posts</h4><ul><li><a href="/tax-news/state-of-the-union-2026-tax-money-highlights">State of the Union (2/24): Tax & Money Highlights — What Was Mentioned and What It Could Mean for Your Return</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news/offer-in-compromise-myth-vs-fact">Offer in Compromise: Myth vs Fact (What the IRS Actually Looks At)</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news/currently-not-collectible-cnc-how-it-works">Currently Not Collectible (CNC): When the IRS Can Pause Collections Because You Can’t Afford to Pay</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news/irs-penalty-abatement-first-time-abate-reasonable-cause">IRS Penalty Abatement: First Time Abate vs Reasonable Cause (and What Actually Works)</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news/1099-vs-scorp-sole-prop-when-to-incorporate-yourself">1099 vs Sole Proprietor vs S‑Corp: When Does It Make Sense to “Incorporate Yourself”?</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><p class="footer-disclaimer">By clicking "SUBSCRIBE" or "SUBMIT," I agree to be contacted by Wynn Tax Solutions and its affiliates via prerecorded and/or telemarketing calls and/or SMS/MMS text messages...</p><p class="footer-copyright">© 2026 Wynn Tax Solutions, LLC.
