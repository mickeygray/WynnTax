This temporary relief pauses all IRS collection efforts, providing you with much-needed breathing room to regain your financial stability. At Wynn Tax Solutions, we specialize in helping individuals and businesses determine if they qualify for CNC status and guiding them through the process of securing this valuable relief.</p><p class="page-body">Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status is a designation given by the IRS when they determine that you cannot afford to pay your tax debt. When you qualify for CNC status, the IRS temporarily halts collection actions such as wage garnishments, bank levies, or tax liens. While this status does not eliminate your debt, it provides immediate relief by pausing aggressive collection efforts, allowing you the time and space you need to resolve your financial challenges.</p><p class="page-body">CNC status is typically granted when your monthly income is insufficient to cover both your basic living expenses and your tax debt. The IRS will assess your financial situation, including your income, expenses, and assets, to determine if you meet the criteria for CNC status.</p><p class="page-body">Securing CNC status can be complex, especially when you’re dealing with financial hardship. Our team at Wynn Tax Solutions has the expertise to guide you through the entire process, ensuring that all the necessary documentation is provided and that your financial situation is accurately represented to the IRS.</p><p class="page-body">If CNC status is not an option for your situation, we can explore other tax relief methods, such as negotiating a payment plan or seeking an offer in compromise. Our goal is to find the best solution for your specific circumstances, offering you the most favorable outcome possible.</p><p class="page-body">If you’re struggling with tax debt and are unable to pay due to financial hardship, CNC status may be the solution you need. We are here to support you during this challenging time, providing the relief you need to regain control of your financial future. Let us help you secure the breathing room you deserve and find a path to resolving your tax debt.
