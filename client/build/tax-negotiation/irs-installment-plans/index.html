Fortunately, the IRS offers installment plans that allow you to break your tax debt into manageable monthly payments. At Wynn Tax Solutions, we specialize in helping individuals and businesses set up IRS installment plans that fit their budget while keeping them compliant with IRS requirements.</p><p class="page-body">An IRS installment plan is an agreement between you and the IRS that allows you to pay off your tax debt over time in smaller, more manageable payments. Instead of paying your entire debt in a lump sum, the IRS agrees to let you make monthly payments until your debt is paid in full. These plans can help you avoid the immediate financial burden of paying a large tax bill all at once, giving you the time you need to get back on track.</p><p class="page-body">The terms of an installment plan depend on the amount of tax debt you owe, your financial situation, and the length of time it will take to pay off your debt. An installment plan can be a great way to stay compliant with the IRS while still making progress toward resolving your debt.</p><p class="page-body">Setting up an IRS installment plan provides several key benefits. First and foremost, it allows you to avoid harsh IRS collection actions such as wage garnishments, bank levies, or tax liens. Instead of worrying about these aggressive measures, you can focus on making manageable monthly payments.</p><p class="page-body">An installment plan also provides you with a structured repayment schedule, giving you the opportunity to pay off your tax debt without the stress of trying to come up with a lump sum. Once the plan is in place, you’ll have peace of mind knowing that you are taking the necessary steps to resolve your tax debt and remain compliant with IRS requirements.</p><p class="page-body">It’s important to remember that, in order to keep your installment plan in good standing, you must continue to file your tax returns on time and pay your taxes for the current year. Missing payments or failing to meet these obligations can lead to penalties, interest, and the potential cancellation of your installment agreement. Our team will help you stay on track with your payments and ensure that you remain compliant with IRS rules throughout the life of the plan.</p><p class="page-body">Don’t let tax debt overwhelm you — take the first step today toward resolving your tax obligations and achieving financial peace of mind with an IRS installment plan. Get in touch with us today at Wynn Tax Solutions for expert help that you can trust!</p></section></main><div class="stewart-widget-container"><button aria-label="Open Ask Stewart" class="stewart-fab"><div class="stewart-fab-icon"><svg fill="none" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M12 2C6.48 2 2 6.48 2 12C2 13.54 2.38 14.99 3.06 16.26L2 22L7.74 20.94C9.01 21.62 10.46 22 12 22C17.52 22 22 17.52 22 12C22 6.48 17.52 2 12 2Z" fill="white"></path></svg></div><span class="stewart-fab-text">Ask Stewart</span></button></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-container"><div class="footer-column"><h4>Menu Links</h4><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/our-tax-services">Services</a></li><li><a href="/tax-faqs">Tax FAQs</a></li><li><a href="/about-us">About Us</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news">Tax News</a></li><li><a href="/contact-us">Contact Us</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-column center"><img src="/images/logo-wynn-small.png" alt="Tax Advocate Group Logo" class="footer-logo"><p>21625 Prairie Street, Suite #200</p><p>Chatsworth, CA 91311</p><p><a href="tel:+18449966829" class="phone-button" aria-label="Call (844) 996-6829"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa-solid fa-phone"></i> CALL: (844) 996-6829</a></p></div><div class="footer-column"><h4>Recent Posts</h4><ul><li><a href="/tax-news/offer-in-compromise-myth-vs-fact">Offer in Compromise: Myth vs Fact (What the IRS Actually Looks At)</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news/currently-not-collectible-cnc-how-it-works">Currently Not Collectible (CNC): When the IRS Can Pause Collections Because You Can’t Afford to Pay</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news/irs-penalty-abatement-first-time-abate-reasonable-cause">IRS Penalty Abatement: First Time Abate vs Reasonable Cause (and What Actually Works)</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news/1099-vs-scorp-sole-prop-when-to-incorporate-yourself">1099 vs Sole Proprietor vs S‑Corp: When Does It Make Sense to “Incorporate Yourself”?</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news/irs-collection-notices-cp14-cp501-cp503-cp504-lt11-1058">IRS Collection Notices Explained: CP14, CP501, CP503, CP504, LT11 — and What to Do If You Owe</a></li><li><a href="/tax-news/live-work-different-states-surprise-tax-bill">Live in One State, Work in Another?
